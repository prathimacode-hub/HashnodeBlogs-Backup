## ‚úîProjects Involved

Contribution period was from 10th June 2021 - 10th Aug, 2021 and I had contributed 2 projects to this open source program. 

1.  [Awesome_Python_Scripts](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts)
2. [ML-ProjectKart](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart)

The main intention to start these projects was to help participants to get introduced to open source and get them exposured to practical skills off their content under wider scope.

It merely felt like building up the project completely from scratch. My wholesome thanks to all the contributors who had extensively worked on various projects and given their utmost dedication and zeal to learn and progress through this program. And not the least, mentors of this project who made this repository worth inviting and had shown exclusive leadership qualities. 

It's all the combined efforts put together by everyone involved in these projects to make this contribution period successful. This program definitely attained me a sense of accomplishment that my projects turned out to be beneficial and had reached an ultimate milestone.
