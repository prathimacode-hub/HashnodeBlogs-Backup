## My Experience at MLH-Local Hack Day:Share

Hello, **All**

Welcome back. Today, I had come up to share my first-time experience I had with MLH-Local Hack Day Share. By the way, this is not a technical post but I'm sure you will enjoy my journey as much as I did.

If you're wondering what it is about or you are hearing this term for the first just head to this [**page**](https://localhackday.mlh.io/). So, let's elaborate this further.

**Major League Hacking** is an abbreviation of MLH. It's a hacker community and mission driven organization to empower hackers. They conduct weekend and weeklong competitions, teach skills and inspire innovations though various programs. 

üëá**Local Hack Day: Share** is a week-long celebration full of activities, learning, workshops, tasks and many more to celebrate hacking together. It's open for everyone be it a first-timer or member, be it a professional or newbie. There are ton of challenges to conquer from a beginner friendly to pro from a pick of technical, design and social challenges. As theme mentions, sharing is caring. It emphasis more of collaborations and growing together as a community.

One fine day, I had come across a random post on LinkedIn which says about this hackathon and referral link to join. I had no clue of it, neither I did know about it earlier. Out of curiosity, I had checked the webpage shared and in the first look all I did notice was Ellie, the Elephant. That instantly stamped my interest to register and give this a try. 

üë®‚ÄçüíªAs a part of the registration, I had to choose a guild community to join. I was neither into open source by then but wanted to dig somehow. I have seen few [Eddie Jaoude](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5mnBodB73bR88fLXHSfzYA) videos on opensource and also about being supportive through the posts I get from my networking community. With little familiarity, I hesitatingly picked EddieHub and had become an official **guild member** of it. 

Community was so welcoming and inclusive for a first timer like me. As it says, Collaboration first and Code second. This week long event had begun with wide range of challenges which were quite exciting and fun to build them. MLH had as well organized many hands-on sesions and workshops to get our hands dirty to add up the learning opportunity to hackers who are not familiar with tech stacks.   

<h2>üéØMy Assets</h2>

I had filled my bag with lots of assets to share. Few were challenging, few were fun but enthusiasm from the community was always high to give our best and support each other. All ready to glance my assets? Let's color this blog post with some of them.


**Share Coffee with Guild**

Having a call with guild community, interacting and sharing knowledge with all these wonderful people was less of a task but more of a fun. One such highlight is to know guild members on a personal front. Felt thrilled to have joined.

There are many more such assets which isn't accessible to showcase in this blog post. But no worries, you can find them all in my [repository](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/MLH-LocalHackDay_Share). It might be interest to know that I had also created a [Travel Brochure](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/MLH-LocalHackDay_Share/tree/main/TravelBrochure) and planned a [Business](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/MLH-LocalHackDay_Share/tree/main/Create_A_Business_Plan).

Not to forget, the projects I had done was an immense learning phase overall to implement them through applications. It helped me shape into a better developer with team work and collaborations. I had caught an eyes on lots of new technical skills and domain which I wouldn't have done if not taken this opportunity. My Projects can be found in my [DevPost](https://devpost.com/kadariprathima4?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav) page.

<h2>üöÄLeaderboard</h2>

After a tiring week of challenges and contributions, it feels so nice to be in #50th position. I know i had given my best though there were lot more unfinished tasks to do. Irrespective of scores, that was one of the most productive week.

<h2>üí≠Things I had come across in my MLH Journey</h2>

- **Ryan** and **Mary**, the organizers of this event had done an incredible job. The main purpose was to encourage more and more hackers to come forward and do their contributions. They also made sure participants are empowered in a right way. 
- Irrespective of guild community they belong, all are willing to help, guide and answer your queries.
- It actually didn't look like a competition but a learning experience where hackers nurture and grow together. 
- You get better in collaborations and communication. This event helped me in knowing the importance of github and opensource.
- You work as a team and  support your guild. Diverse ideas comes together to form a worthy project.


This experience had been possible with all the nicest decisions taken together that turned into a wonderful moment to remember. Special thanks to **Major League Hacking** and **EddieHub** community.
