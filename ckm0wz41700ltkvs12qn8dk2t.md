## #ChooseToChallenge: Women Rising - The Unseen Barriers

This article is part of the #ChooseToChallenge campaign by  [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) . It's a wonderful intiative.

Hello, everyone. I, therefore #choosetochallenge and put my thoughts on it. Though we have reached 2021, I could still notice the bias shown on women and seen people judging the capabilities with respect to the gender they belong. I always believe that women are self reliant, strong and independent. They are capable to achieve anything they strive for and all they need is a fair chance to prove themselves. 

Few days earlier, I've heard a male say. "It's a man's world". I was puzzled by these words as how most of them are unable to digest the fact that women are progressing.  Why is it that women are considered less and expected to be? I, then realized that this fault comes from generations and thoughts they're feeded within their minds since older generations. That legacy is moving forward and people aren't ready to let go of these myths. It's indeed difficult for them to accept that women are way beyond than they could ever imagine. Saying this, it's not just women but on whatever conditions any gender is differentiated. There shouldn't be any subconscious bias. Acceptance is the main key factor which would break a thin line between genders.  

Be the change you want to see in the world - Mahatma Gandhi

The change would come only when you illustrate it to people by being an example of how genders should be equally treated on same terms. Gender equality is important to educate the future generations and instill with right thoughts since their younger age. So that society takes this forward in a right direction of approval. It's achieved only when they are respected and valued equally along with encouragement they show on woman for their progress in their lives. It's a basic human right. This isn't any luxury that it should be incorporated to make lives better. 

Other main obstacle I've seen is nothing but stereotypes. It still does exist in modern era. Women are given the limitations of what they are supposed to do or not do and it hinders their freedom to take their own decisions. Women should be included in all the decisions be it career, life or financial matters. Joining roles and responsibilities with respect to the gender only lowers the confidence and puts halt to their thoughts. The capabilities of a person shouldn't be judged by the gender they belong. And both the genders should equally participate in household chores and workspaces and shower their support for each other without being hesitant. As said by  [Edidiong Asikpo](https://hashnode.com/@didicodes), we should work for an inclusive world together.

We need to reshape our own perception of how we view ourselves. We have to step up as women and take the lead - Michelle Obama

Women are the driving force. They undergo multiple roles and responsibilities throughout her life and excels in whatever she does. They are imbibed with great leadership qualities and dedicate herself unconditionally in whatever role she is in. You all might have heard a saying, behind every successful man there is a woman. I therefore expect to see the change in this saying by stating "Behind every successful woman, there is a man". 

With all these down the lane and seeing where I'm today, I immensely feel proud to have overcomed many thorns across my life and stood confident. My enduring message to women is to always love yourself and see the spark it does to you. We are special.

We need to act now and influence the system. Where there is a woman, there is a magic.

Happy International Women's day.

I was intially skeptical about expressing my views but on a ocassion of IWD, I wanted to take a stand on behalf of all the women to uplift and enlighten the society.
